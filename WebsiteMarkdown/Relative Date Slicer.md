# Power BI Relative Date Slicer Solution

## Summary
In Power BI a commonly requested functionality for slicers, especially date related slicers is the ability to have a default value stored in the slicer to help end users. Imagine you have a sales report that all regional managers in your organization use to see their performance on a weekly basis. In this scenario you would want a default slicer value that would limit the data on the report to "This Week" or maybe "Last Week" without them having to change slicers every time they run the report. 

For the longest time this was simply not possible to achieve in Power BI until Microsoft added native functionality enabling what they call relative date slicers. [MSFT Learn Relative Date Slicer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/desktop-slicer-filter-date-range) 

To be clear, I think this is great functionality and works perfectly in most standard use cases. However, if your requirements get more complicated than any of the basic scenarios covered by this slicer behavior then you will not be able to resolve it solely within the slicer functionality itself and you will need to take some extra steps to implement a solution. Let's consider a more complicated relative date slicer scenario that we will work through.
